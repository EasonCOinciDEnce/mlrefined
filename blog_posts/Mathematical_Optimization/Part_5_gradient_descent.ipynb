However determining which direction to travel in order to decrease the value of a function - at least by examining the function directly - is no simple matter in general.  This is because a function that takes in $N$ inputs.\n",

Starting at an initial point $\\mathbf{w}^{0}$ and by carefully choosing how far we travel at each step, the gradient descent procedure produces a sequence of points $\\mathbf{w}^{1},\\,\\mathbf{w}^{2},\\,\\mathbf{w}^{3}...$, that shrinks the value of $g$ at each step and eventually reaches a stationary point of $g$.
