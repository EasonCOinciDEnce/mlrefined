    "In the previous post we discussed the fitting of a linear model to a set of input/output points - otherwise known as *linear regression*.  In general all sorts of nonlinear phenomenon present themselves and the data they generate - whose input and output share a nonlinear relationship - are poorly modeled using a linear model, thus causing linear regression to perform rather poorly.  This naturally leads to the exploration of fitting *nonlinear* functions to data, referred to in general as *nonlinear regression*.\n",

    "In this post we describe a very particular form of nonlinear regression called *logistic regression* that is designed to deal with a very particular kind of dataset that is commonly dealt with in machine learning / deep learning: *two-class classification data*.  This sort of data is distinguished by the fact that its output values are constrained to be either one of two fixed values.  As we will see, such a constraint naturally leads to the choice of a *logistic sigmoid function* as the ideal nonnlinear function to fit to such data, hence the name *logistic regression*."

The actual value of these numbers is in principle arbitrary, but particular value pairs are more helpful than others for derivation purposes (i.e., it is easier to determine a proper nonlinear function to regress on the data for particular output value pairs).  We will use $y_{p}\\in\\left\\{ -1,\\,+1\\right\\}$ - that is every output takes on either the value $+1$ or $-1$."
